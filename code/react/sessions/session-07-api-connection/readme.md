# Session 07: Establishing API Connections

## 💪 Motivation

This session delves into fetching data from APIs within React applications. Further you will interact dynamically with APIs by sending and updating data efficiently in React applications.

You'll learn to manage side effects efficiently to load external data and update the user interface. You will know strategies for optimistic UI updates to immediately reflect changes, improving user experience with real-time responsiveness.

## 🎯 Learning objectives

- Using `fetch` in React to load data from an API
- Understanding the `useEffect` hook
- Understanding the concept of side effects
- Deeper comprehension of  the render cycle in React
- Using `fetch` to send data to an API
- Re-fetching data after update
- Separating events from effects
- Applying optimistic UI updates
