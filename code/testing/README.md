# Unit testing with Jest

(jest)[https://jestjs.io/] is a popular test automation framework for JavaScript. In the examples here, it is used to facilitate Unit Tests.

`formatDate` shows a use case for a very compact test to run on straight forward functions with many in-out possibilities but not too much logic in their effects.

`crud` contains a partial implementation of a basic RESTful API and tests for it - feel free to fill out the empty tests and add the remaining functions!
